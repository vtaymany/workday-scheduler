# Workday Scheduler

## Main project goal

- The main goal of this app is to provide a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

### Instructions

- Open the application

- The current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar

- Scroll down to view the time block for standard business hours

  - Grey blocks represent the past hours
  - The red block represents the current hour
  - Green blocks represent future hours

- Click into any time block

- Enter an event

- Click save for that time block

- The event will remain even if the user refreshes the page

## Installation

- No installation is required. The application may be viewed [here](https://vtaymany.github.io/workday-scheduler/)

## Roadmap

- The UI may be improved following best UI practices
- Since Moment.js is no longer supported by its developers it might be worth looking into other libraries
- Make calendars available for others (with possible functionalities such as merging calendars and highlighting conflicts)
